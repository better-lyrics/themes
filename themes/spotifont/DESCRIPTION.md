# Spotifont
Using **Spotify Mix UI font** as the lyrics font instead of Satoshi. I don't know if I could get in trouble with this one

## Features
- It looks nice, maybe brings you back to the time where you're still using Spotify
- For screen recording some parts of a song, could make people assume you're using Spotify
- Spotify haters, please don't attack me. I'm just bored. Look at Apple Music theme! (much more cleaner)
